The following Privacy Policy summarizes the various ways that <strong>iFaru.</strong>
(&quot;Service Provider,&quot; &quot;we&quot; or &quot;our&quot;) treats the
information you provide while using <strong>www.ifaru.com</strong>
(&quot;Website&quot;). It is our goal to bring you information that is tailored
to your individual needs and, at the same time, protect your privacy. <br>
<br>
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. You can access the Privacy Policy
any time at <strong>http://www.ifaru.com/ifaru/Privacy.html</strong>. <strong>Your
use of and/or registration on any aspect of the Website will constitute your
agreement to this Privacy Policy.</strong> If you cannot agree with the terms
and conditions of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Website. This
Privacy Policy does not cover information collected elsewhere, including
without limitation offline and on sites linked to from the Website. <br>
<br>
In addition to reviewing this Privacy Policy, please read our User Agreement.
Your use of the Website constitutes agreement to its terms and conditions as
well. <br>
<br>
This Privacy Policy may be modified from time to time; the date of the most
recent revisions will appear on this page, so check back often. Continued
access of the Website by you will constitute your acceptance of any changes or
revisions to the Privacy Policy. <br>
<br>
<strong>I. THE TYPE OF INFORMATION THE WEBSITE COLLECTS</strong> <br>
<br>
The Website generally collects personally identifying information with your
specific knowledge and consent. For instance, when you enter a sweepstakes or
contest, complete a survey, make a purchase, subscribe to our publication(s),
or register for any portion of our services, you are asked to provide
information such as your e-mail address, name or phone number. Optional
information such as your age or gender may also be requested. <br>
<br>
Our servers may also automatically collect information about your computer when
you visit the Website, including without limitation the type of browser
software you use, the operating system you are running, the website that
referred you, and your Internet Protocol (&quot;IP&quot;) address. Your IP
address is usually associated with the place from which you enter the Internet,
like your Internet Service Provider, your company or your university. <br>
<br>
<strong>II. HOW THE WEBSITE USES INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU</strong> <br>
<br>
Service Provider uses personally identifying information you supply through the
Website to provide you with the service you have requested. For example, if you
subscribe to any of our publications, we may use your e-mail address to send
you a confirmation notice and your mailing address to send you the publication.
Similarly, if you enter an online sweepstakes, we will use this information to
notify you if you are a winner. We may also use the information to communicate
with you about new features, products or services, and/or to improve the
services that we offer by tailoring them to your needs. <br>
<br>
Unless otherwise specified on the Website, Service Provider may sell or share
personally identifying information with our affiliates and with carefully
selected companies who we think can offer you services and products of interest
to you. If you do not wish to have your personally identifying information
shared, write to us at the street address set forth at the end of this
document. If you do not wish to receive future commercial communications from
us by e-mail, simply follow the unsubscribe instructions contained within the
e-mail. If you've registered on any part of the Website, please use the
mechanism on the Website that allows you to change or update your member
preferences or information, if available, to keep all such date accurate and
up-to-date. Otherwise, contact our Privacy Policy Coordinator as described
below with your changes. <br>
<br>
We also allow access to our database by third parties that provide us with
services, such as technical maintenance or forums and job search software, but
only for the purpose of and to the extent necessary to provide those services.
And if you choose to purchase items through features on the Website, we may
forward your information to third parties for services such as credit card
processing and order fulfilment. There are also times when you provide
information about yourself to us in areas of the site that may be managed or
participated in by third parties, such as auction services or shopping areas.
In such cases, the information may be used by us and by such third party(ies),
each pursuant to its own policies. We may also provide your information to our
advertisers, so that they can serve ads to you that meet your needs or match
your interests. While Service Provider will seek to require such third parties
to follow appropriate privacy policies and will not authorize them to use this
information except for the express purpose for which it is provided, Service
Provider does not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of third
parties. There may also be occasion when we are legally required to provide
access to our database in order to cooperate with police investigations or
other legal proceedings. In those instances, the information is provided only
for that purpose. <br>
<br>
In addition, we reserve the right to use the information we collect about your
computer, which may at times be able to identify you, for any lawful business
purpose, including without limitation to help diagnose problems with our
servers, to gather broad demographic information, and to otherwise administer
our Website. <br>
<br>
While your personally identifying information is protected as outlined above,
we reserve the right to use, transfer, sell, and share aggregated, anonymous
data about our users as a group for any business purpose, such as analyzing
usage trends and seeking compatible advertisers and partners. <br>
<br>
In addition, as our business changes, we may buy or sell various assets. In the
event all or a portion of the assets owned or controlled by Service Provider,
its parent or any subsidiary or affiliated entity are sold, assigned,
transferred or acquired by another company, the information from and about our
Website users may be among the transferred assets. <br>
<br>

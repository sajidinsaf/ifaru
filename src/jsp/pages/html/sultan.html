                       <span style="color:#0404B4;font-style:italic"> Sultan  </span> is a rich oriental with sharp woods, chypre, spices and a pronounced rose note but keeps its over the top masculinity regardless.
                      <br>
                          It opens with a bright yet warm fruit note (not candied), then the rose blooms bright with the help of saffron and other spice, sandalwood and agarwood, then dries down with musk, more agarwood, and vetiver.

              This smells like a classic Arabic composition, heady and powerful, you can't mistake it from anything else. 
              <br>It is a very versatile perfume. Its powdery chypre nature reminds a little of Antaeus without the stuffiness. Rather heady, think twice however about wearing this to work.

                 <br>
                   Sparkling and invigorating freshness, a natural and radiant sensuality, heightening the scent of a breeze against bare skin... to create an infinitely seductive feel.

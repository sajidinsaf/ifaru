          The source forests are controlled by governmental authorities so the felling of
          trees is controlled and legal. The source wood as described in the 'preparation'
          section is dead and decomposed naturally when it is felled therefore the tree is
          at the end of its life anyway. The business ensures that for each tree felled a
          new tree is replanted and grown organically.

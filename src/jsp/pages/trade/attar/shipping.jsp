          iFaru uses various shipping companies based on geographical coverage and costs. Each company is tested by iFaru by sending dummy shipments to Europe, USA, Middle-East and Australia. Only companies that meet iFaru's highest delivery standards are included on the preferred service providers list.<br>
  
  
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">How long will it take to arrive?</span><br>
  
          When you place an order, we'll estimate dispatch and delivery dates for you based on the availability of your items and the delivery options you choose. iFaru guarantees that every effort will be made to get the shipment delivered with the estimated duration. However iFaru cannot be heald responsible for circumstances beyond iFaru's control and jurisdiction.<br>
          
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">How much cost?</span><br>
          The cost of shipping depends upon the weight of the item, geographical location and local custom laws. iFaru does not make any profit on postage and only charges the exact costs incurred.

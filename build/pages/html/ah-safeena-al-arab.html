             Safeena al Arab by Al Haramain is a warm and harmonic Pefume with head notes of Flowers and Indian Agarwood.
             A beguiling, oriental fragrance.
             <br>
               The wonderfully sweet spicy / woody fragrance is packaged in a beautiful boat shaped perfume bottle, which sits inside a box, giving the impression that its floating in the sea. The overall presentation makes this an ideal and highly recommended gift.

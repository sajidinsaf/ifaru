                       The name  <span style="color:#DF0101;font-style:italic"> 'Amariage'</span> is an anagram of the French word <span style="color:#DF0101;font-style:italic"> "Mariage"  </span>, so this is a very 
                       romantic floral fragrance.

                     Amarige is the symbol of femininity, radiating and bursting with happiness, a

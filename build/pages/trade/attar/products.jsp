        <span style="text-decoration:underline; color: #5F5A59;">Agarwood</span> is the most expensive wood in the world. It is valued in many cultures for
        its distinctive fragrance, and used extensively in incense and perfumes.<br>
        Agarwood is the occasional product of two to four genera in the family
        Thymelaeaceae, with Aquilaria agallocha , Aquilaria crassna and Aquilaria
        malaccensis the best known species. The wood is formed as a result of the tree's
        immune response to fungal infection.<br>
        When burnt, the wood produces a fragrance that is soothing and calming. The smoke
        produced during the burning process is said to be medicinal by ongoing research
        studies. A particular characteristic of the smoke is that it does not burn the eyes.

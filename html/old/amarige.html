                       The name  <span style="color:#DF0101;font-style:italic"> 'Amariage'</span> is an anagram of the French word <span style="color:#DF0101;font-style:italic"> "Mariage"  </span>, so this is a very 
                       romantic floral fragrance. 
                  <br>
                     Amarige is the symbol of femininity, radiating and bursting with happiness, a 
                    zest for life and generosity.

                          The Amarige woman is radiant and open-minded; her heart-felt joy is evident 
                          from her spontaneous, charming smile. 
                  <br>
                        
                      A celebration of love and intense happiness. It is like a cheerful, tender and sensual flower bouquet.

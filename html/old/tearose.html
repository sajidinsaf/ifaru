         <p style="margin-left: 50px; text-align:left; font: 12pt Georgia;"><span style="color: #FF0000; text-decoration:underline">ABOUT THE MANUFACTURER:</span> The family run business adheres to strict social principles to ensure trade fairness, legality, general social welfare and minimum impact to the environment at every stage of the production process. It provides an essential source of employment and income for the tribal communities from the forested region where the raw ingredients for the perfumes are obtained.</p>
         <p style="margin-left: 50px; text-align:left; font: 12pt Georgia;"><span style="color: #FF0000; text-decoration:underline">ADDITIONAL INFO:</span> The process of extracting <span style="color:#FF0000;font-style:italic">Rose</span> oil from the petals of the flower is a very intensive process. The <span style="color:#FF0000;font-style:italic">Rose</span> buds are plucked when they have just opened up and before the sun's rays diminish the oils, which contain the essence of their perfume. Harvesting of flowers is done by hand in the morning before sunrise. Due to the labour- intensive production process and the low content of oil in the <span style="color:#FF0000;font-style:italic">Rose</span> blooms, <span style="color:#FF0000;font-style:italic">Rose</span> oil commands a very high price.</p>

       <p style="margin-left: 50px; text-align:left; font: 10pt Georgia;"><span style="color:#8A4117; text-decoration:underline">ADDITIONAL INFO:</span> The best quality oil comes from the Indian province of
            Mysore and Tamil Nadu where the harvest of White Sandalwood trees are protected by the state government making it rare and expensive to buy.
            In 1792 sandalwood was declared a "royal tree" by the Sultan of Mysore – a status that continues today with the Indian government "owning" all
             the sandalwood trees.</p>

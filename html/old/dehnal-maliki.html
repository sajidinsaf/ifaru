          <P style="FONT: 12pt Georgia; MARGIN-LEFT: 50px; TEXT-ALIGN: left"><SPAN style="COLOR: #b40404; TEXT-DECORATION: underline">ADDITIONAL INFO:</SPAN> The Aquilaria/ Agarwood tree grows up to 40 meters high and 60 centimeters in diameter. It bears sweetly-scented, snow-white flowers. These trees form resins that can then produce 
           some of the highest quality oudh oils. The trees frequently become infected with a parasite fungus or mold, Phialophora parasitica, and begin to produce an aromatic resin, in response to this attack. The results are achieved by allowing plenty of time for infection to take place, and preferably in the forest or other non-contrived settings. Eventually, this infection 
          will cause the tree to die, and Agarwood resin can then be chipped away, in various grades. The fungus and decomposition process continue to generate a very rich and dark resin forming within the heartwood. Thus, Aloeswood develops very,very slowly over time-typically several HUNDRED YEARS or more to form. 
         <BR>
            Hence, this is why it is so rare and valued as the most sacred oil on the planet (in addition to the wonderful aroma)

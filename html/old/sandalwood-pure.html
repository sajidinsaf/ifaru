         <p style="margin-left: 50px; text-align:left; font: 10pt Georgia;"><span style="color:#8A4117; text-decoration:underline">ABOUT THE MANUFACTURER:</span> The family run business adheres to strict social principles to ensure trade fairness, legality, general social welfare and minimum impact to the environment at every stage of the production process. It provides an essential source of employment and income for the tribal communities from the forested region where the raw ingredients for the perfumes are obtained.</p>
         <p style="margin-left: 50px; text-align:left; font: 10pt Georgia;"><span style="color:#8A4117; text-decoration:underline">ADDITIONAL INFO:</span> The best quality oil comes from the Indian province of
            Mysore and Tamil Nadu where the harvest of Sandalwood trees are protected by the state government making it rare and expensive to buy.
            In 1792 sandalwood was declared a "royal tree" by the Sultan of Mysore – a status that continues today with the Indian government "owning" all
             the sandalwood trees.</p>

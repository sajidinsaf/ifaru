             As pure as budding rose, before the first touch of caring bee. Feel it in Affaf Perfume Oil
             <br>
             This is one of the most romantic and sweet fragranced oil that you will have ever used. It is soft, rosy with a touch of dehan al oudh and amber. Goes on slightly sweet, but then later turns into a rich scent that is truly captivating.
             <br>
               The wonderful fragrance is presented in a beautiful golden bottle in an exotic box.

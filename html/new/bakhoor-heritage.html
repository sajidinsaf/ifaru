                        <br>
                        <br>
                             It is traditional to burn incense in the house and outside as it not only adds a beautiful fragrance to the dwelling, but also repels <span style="color:#585858;font-style:italic">negative energy. </span> 
                           <br>
                           <br>
                               <span style="color:#585858;font-style:italic">Method of burning Bakhoor: </span> Take a piece of Arab Coal and heat a corner of it with a small flame (lighter/cooker), for about 60 seconds until it becomes red hot.
                           <br>
                               Be very careful not to burn onself (handle with metal tongs or similar instrument). Do not let hot coal touch skin.
                           <br>
                               Place hot piece of coal in incense burner or suitable metal dish.
                           <br>
                             Wait for 2 minutes, then sprinkle small amount of  <span style="color:#585858;font-style:italic">Bakhoor Heritage </span> Incense onto hot coal.
                             Sit back as beautiful fragrance fills the room.
                             <br>
                            <br>
                              The bakhoor weaves together an aromatic bouquet of raw materials such as sandalwood, frankincense and mixture of the essence of Oud, Musk, Amber, Rose etc..........it is truly heavenly.

        Pure Agarwood is immersed in water and then boiled several times to get a concentrated perfume. The resulting oil is then preserved for many years.
        <br>
        Dehnal Oudh body lotion is extracted from this oil. The pleasant smelling Dehnal Oudh protects your skin from the harsh rays of the sun and other pollutants.
        It even works as a good moisturiser. It can be appliesd all over the body for a luxurious feeling.

        <br>
        A creation with care from Al Haramain.
